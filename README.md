# Diabetes Data Analysis

A 3 Part Python-based project using the libraries pandas, numpy, sklearn to analyze the diabetes dataset from the Medtronic 670G system (artificial pancreas medical control system).

##Part 1:

Calculated average per day percentage of records under hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic conditions from the diabetes dataset in the Medtronic 670G system (artificial pancreas medical control system), programmed in Python (ML)

##Part 2:

Extracted useful meal and no-meal data from over 22,000 data samples recorded by the Continuous Glucose Sensor and Insulin Pump, trained an SVM classifier to categorize into meal and no-meal classes, and achieved an accuracy of 80%

##Part 3:

Implemented K-Means, DBSCAN on generated feature matrix to visualize clusters of similar records with low SSE of 72,6
